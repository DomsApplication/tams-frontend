# This workflow runs only for PRs raised by dependabot.
# The reason why this needs to be a standalone workflow is because GitHub prohibits dependabot PRs to access GitHub secrets.
# Since our CI workflow deals with GitHub secrets for image push to ECR, we cannot have dependabot workflow inside CI workflow.
